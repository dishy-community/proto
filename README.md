# Dishy Protobuf Definitions

Protobuf definitions for interacting with the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service implemented on the Starlink 
user terminal (AKA "the dish" / "[Dishy McFlatface](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/dishy-mcflatface)").

While it is possible to directly generate code from descriptor sets, having proto files better integrates with workflows.

## File Generation
These files have been generated by extracting the descriptor set using [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl),
[server reflection](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md),
and decompiling them using [proto-decompiler](https://github.com/51systems/proto-decompiler).

For example:
```shell
grpcurl -plaintext -protoset-out dish.protoset 192.168.100.1:9200 describe SpaceX.API.Device.Device
proto-decompiler --out . dish.protoset
```

Thanks to [sparky8512](https://github.com/sparky8512) for laying the foundation with
[starlink-grpc-tools](https://github.com/sparky8512/starlink-grpc-tools) and the folks over at
[r/Starlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/) for investigating the protocol!
